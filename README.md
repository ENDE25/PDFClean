# PDFClean
Ultra simple utility to remove specific pages from a PDF file

It is available in:
- **.exe** file (Windows executable) --> [PDFClean.exe](PDFClean.exe)
- **.py** file (python) --> [PDFClean.py](PDFClean.py)

_You don't need to install the .exe file on your computer, as it is a portable program and does not require admin permissions. If you find any problems trying to open it, just download the python version and run it with `python PDFClean.py`_
>⚠️ This is a simple project, so the Windows executable (.exe) isn’t signed. Because of that, it might trigger security warnings in the browser or Windows, but that doesn’t mean it’s malicious or unsafe in any way.
